# Audio-Classification-Deep-Learning

In the last few years, one of the most prevalent topics concerning machine learning application is Environmental Sound Classification (ESC). The fields of application for ESC are in abundance, with notable examples like “Shazam” or “Alexa”. The interest around all that concerns “smart speaking” is inviting the attention of market leaders such as “Google, Amazon and Facebook” and with this attention, focused research and investment. An important feature of this type of learning is the upgrading of their performance based on the live, constant learning from repe- titive human habits.
The aim of this project is to exploit learning algorithm such as Neural Networks architecture, showing the most interesting result from 2 type of algorithm as Feed Forward Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Networks
